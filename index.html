    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy describes how the Personal Whoop Automation
      application ("the App") collects, uses, and protects data accessed from
      your WHOOP account. This is a personal automation tool developed for
      individual use to integrate WHOOP recovery data with workflow automation
      systems.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Developer Information</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Developer:</strong> Shahad Eissa<br />

    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection</h2>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Recovery Data:</strong> Recovery scores, HRV, resting heart
        rate, respiratory rate, and recovery metrics
      </li>

        as provided by WHOOP
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>

      <li>Triggering workflow automations based on recovery status</li>
      <li>Personal health tracking and analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is handled as follows:</p>
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Retention:</strong> Historical data may be retained for personal
        tracking purposes. You can request deletion at any time.
